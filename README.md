# Modern Java

I'm following along with [Modern Java](https://together-java.github.io/ModernJava/) and decided to upload my "work" to GitHub in case someone finds it useful.
~~GitHub is also a good way to backup projects.~~

If you find this helpful, I recommend following along with the book yourself.

## Java Version

I'm using Java 21 OpenJDK.
